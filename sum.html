        Thank you. Thank you and very good morning to all of you. I think 930 is a bit early for. For you guys. I got 2. I got two boys of your age as well, and I think they're still in bed, so I admire you to be so early. As a professor, as professor just said that I've been in banking almost all my career. 40 odd years and. So today I I understand not all of you are going to be in banking anyway, but so bear with me. My background has mostly been in banking. Although I started as a consultant with Price Waterhouse and with IBM etcetera. But even in those days when I was a consultant, I was also in banking as well in banking and. So even if you are not interested in banking, but I'll tell you more about more about banking and many of the topics I cover today would be useful for other industries as well. So if you are going into, you know, manufacturing or tourism or whatever, I bet that you get some useful. Thoughts. You know from my presentation today.             
So I chose a topic called ABCD of Fintech financial technology. Again, you know banking and finance and I'll cover when I talk about Internet to the matter words. It's really the span of time, you know, from the Internet time to the what we now call the metal words the Web 3.0. So this just just. The topic now I'll cover basically three or four, maybe 4 topics, the last one getting ready for the digital digital age are leave it to the end. If we have time, we do it. If you don't have time, I leave it to you to read about it. OK, so I I cover mostly the 1st 4 topics to begin with. Now spend a span of time. The steam engines, right, that's that's the. You know 1760, I mean the good old days where we have the first industrial revolution, the second one, we talk about electricity. You know, this is motherhood stuff now and then we talk about the third being the computers that really changed a lot of the world. And then today we talked. AI's right. Artificial intelligence. You know, machine learning and all this. Now I think I'm not going to go back to all these good old days, but I'll focus on the 4th, what we call now the 4th Industrial Revolution and and of of this 4th revolution. A lot of things, a lot of things have changed. Many of them are becoming almost daily life. Now you go to buy a memory sticks, right? I remember we talked about megabytes and today we talk about terabytes, right? In banking, for example in banking. Just about 1020 years ago, when people asked us how big is your bank, Michael, you know. And you know when? When I'm asked how big is the bank that I work for and you know, sometimes I said we have, you know, $100 billion of assets. Sometimes we say we have, you know, 200 branches, right? How many branches? Sometimes I talk about. You know how many transactions we do, et cetera. When we ask how big is the bank? I don't talk about the, you know, $200 billion capital. We don't talk about it anymore. We talk about how many customers we have, right, how many, what we call now the digital footprints, digital assets we have. And we don't talk about how many branches we have, you know, 200 branches. We don't talk about that much anymore. We talk about this the, the, the, the bank being 6 and half inch. You know this is the size of the bank. This is the size of the bank. The size of the screen, so we talked about the the whole thing that is now more digital rather than physical. So you see all these changes right from the from place to space. Now all in the cloud we talk instead of people we talk about robots. Now I'll have many more slides to go through this sort of. Changes from diligence working hard, you know, working day and night. Now we talk about intelligence from industrial. We talk about intellectual. The last one is interesting from facts to faith. I don't know if you understand that concept. A lot of the things we do today. Many things we do today has, you know, have never happened before. So I remember when I did my MBA and I'm sure you will probably do similar things, you go to, you go to the archive, you go to Internet and look at the historical figures, right, historical events. Case studies, you know. Right, we do case study. You know, Harvard Business Review you know. You you take. Up similar cases and then you try to understand you know and develop a business case. You know business plan for something. Now that is. The traditional way of doing a a business plan today, many of the things we do. Have never happened before. Completely new, completely revolutionised. So there's no historical data, there's no historical case studies, so a lot of the things we do, I'll give you more examples to come right in the next one hour and a half hours. We believe in it. You know, we believe it. This is going to work and it's a matter of faith. Faith, you know, it's not case study. It's not historical data. So the last one is very interesting. A lot of. The new startups, like I think the famous one like air BN B for example. Yeah, like Airbnb or Uber. You know, when they disrupt the the hotel industry or disrupt the the taxi, let's say taxi industry. They have done something that nobody has done before, so it's a matter of faith, not a matter of facts anymore, right? This sort of sums up the the what I call the digital asset digital value evolution continuum. As I said, we collect a lot of facts every day, many, many millions and trillions of things happen. And from all these events, all these. Happenings we collect a lot of data. There are so many sensors everywhere and today this this, this talk is going to be video recorded. So you collected a lot of data a lot. Of you know. Bits and bytes of things happening, and then we process it into information becoming more useful. It's not just raw data anymore. Then it become an information, something that you can understand. You can read into. And then from information it distil it become knowledge. Yeah, from knowledge we crystallise it into intelligence from intelligence. We do insight now that's very important. Insight means what in English insight means you understand the deep down of it, why you know, why does it happen? Why is it doing this way? So inside is another level. Above intelligence. And then we have finally wisdom. I don't think any other mammal or other creatures have wisdom. I I believe that only humankind. You know, people like us have the thing called wisdom. I don't know the cats and dogs, whether they have wisdom, they probably learn something. They have some, some habits, you know they do. Maybe one day, instead of calling artificial intelligence, maybe we have artificial wisdom. You know, AW1 day. And that is quite scary. I think I'll talk about wisdom in a different context later on. What is actually meant by wisdom, and I have my interpretation of it. I also I I believe that only we have been wisdom human wisdom. That's why instead of calling industrial revolution, I sometimes call it the 4th intellectual revolution. Now all these things happened. All these changes or transformation or evolutions happened because of a number of very important technologies. First one I must say. Mobile because these things, these things. Have really changed the world, isn't it? Right. Although the paradigm is a bit stupid, you know you still have the most of us still hold on. Stick to the ear. I think this is pretty stupid, but you will change one day. I'll talk about it in the next slide. I don't I I think this this old way of doing things. It's quite stupid, you know. You you you wasted one one hand to hold the phone, but many of many of the things that we do today. Have changed so much because of this. This little gadget banking for example. We used to go to the bank, to the, to the branches, right. We used to go to the branches and we used to go to the Internet. You know the big screen and then called Internet banking. In the past we have. Phone banking, you know. Today we have mobile banking, right? It's becoming the daily daily life. I mean, it's motherhood stuff now. And many of the products we developed today. Offered on the phone. Yeah. Many products we do today. Do not. You can't get it. You cannot get it. On the at the branch level. And we make use of a lot of the features that the phone offer. Only the phones can offer. Can you give what? Give. Give me any example that only the phone can do these sort of things. Like payment? Yeah. Today we all. I mean, we all do payment. You you have used the thing called Shake Shake payment. Yeah, so shake, shake payment. Can you hold a computer and shake the computer? You cannot. So after after a game of golf, you know, after a game of golf. Four of us. Finished the game. And then we got to play each other right because of the, you know, we we do some bad thing and you know, we lose some money we we win some money. So I have to pay you $100 and you pay. Me 50 and then we shake, shake. And then shake, shake. Four of us already formed the group. And then we can shake, shake. Of course, the phone can do many other things, right. Camera, GPS. You know, global position systems and voice and keyboards and you know. There are if you count it. There are eight. There are 8 features on the phone that no other device. No other device can do. And as banking? When we developed the products or service. We try to make use of all the features. That on the. Phone like account opening. Right when you open an account. Do we? Do you still have to go to the bank, to the branch to open account? Not anymore. Yeah. So we can do remote account opening. Right remote account opening using the phone. So you take a selfie. You bring your eyes, you open your mouth, you shake your head, make sure you are a live person. Yeah, you are not a. You're not a wax wax figure. You're not a carbon, you know, a carbon copy. So we use the phone to take selfie. To to authenticate to identify this is a a real person. Yeah. This is you. And then it's a live body, you know, you you knock your head, you know, you shake your head, et cetera. So this is only the phone can do. So I better move on.
So mobile.
We are not talking about almost mobile only. Yeah, many products and services are only offered on the mobile now Internet of Things as I said, so many sensors and cameras and microphones and everything all over the place. So collecting a lot of data. And social media is motherhood now cloud. I think it's motherhood, but those are key technologies that have changed the world. And I talk about ABCD. Then we have the artificial intelligence. I'll have some examples for you in the subsequent slides and the B is blockchain. I have it in the next slide and then C of course is cloud. Again, cloud is now motherhood, isn't it? Who who doesn't use clouds? I mean, you are using it before you even know about it, right? All the. You know storage I have, I I don't have. I don't know how many, how many megabytes I have or gigabytes I have on the cloud these days. I I I don't count them anymore. I just keep paying. I just keep playing. You know what? Cheap, right? You go to one of those cloud storage, you know, Apple, Microsoft. They all offer Googles. They all have. Cloud storage space and then I just keep paying. And when I when I reach the maximum then I keep paying. I pick, I pay a bit more and then I get another, you know, 200 gigabytes or something. So everybody uses, everybody uses these. Sort of things now. The others? Ah, by the way, I I put this at the end because. With all these new technologies, most of them, in fact all of them are software. They're all software. I mean cloud, actually. Data AI they're all software, but behind this software. There are three very important breakthroughs. You know, really breakthroughs in terms of hardware. The first one is computing power. I mean these little things I have in my hand is thousands of times more powerful, more powerful. Then that lead to objects still flying to Mars. You know that was launched some 10101015 years ago, still travelling in the in the Galaxy, still flying with all the solar, all the, all the panels. But that thing is probably 1-1 thousandth of the power. Just imagine what is what's in your hand is thousands times more powerful than that little thing that launched by human you know. Some 10-15 years ago. So that's.
The complete multiple times of breakthrough you know, in terms of computing power storage is another thing already talk about, I mean you don't go to the computer computer stores and buy a megabytes memory sticks. I mean, you people laugh at you. You are from the you are from the. Outer space, you know. Today we buy terabytes. Need to think like this right? Happy here. So how big is this right? I think Joseph sort of having the most feeling of it because when I started my career. When I started my career some 30 years ago, 30-40 years ago. I remember the 1st. I I handle, I mean I I I use is that big, right like a big disc and that's 2.5 megabytes. 2.5 megabyte, and that's that's really. Quite a lot. 2.5 megabyte that big. Cartridge. We call it cartridge cartridge disc. Now, by the way. You didn't catch that? That was only that was only 3030, something years ago. Yeah, when I started my career, let's say 40 doesn't matter 40 years ago. I used that much of a disc, very heavy. And 2.5 megabyte, I remembered it. Very well because. Top and bottom, the two of them, one is a fixed. 2.5 mag. One is a movable, you know, removable cartridge and that's 2.5 together is 5 megabytes. Well, this thing has this thing has gigabytes. Network is another thing, yeah. So these are the three very important now we have 5G, right? We have 5G and you guess how much bandwidth we have. So these are the three very important hardware breakthroughs and then I promise you to about blockchain. In fact, I do have a a I do have two or three slides to introduce blockchain to all of you.
But those are very important technologies that have enabled all the changes, all the transformations you. The fourth Industrial Revolution, or the 4th intellectual revolution, OK. I'll cover some of those topics in my presentation, so I'll skip that for now now. With all these changes, all these new breakthroughs in in the technology and the impact on the business on the business activities. The impacts are summarised in 3D's right. That's very important. I always talk about the 3D's. I've experienced it first hand as a banker. The first one is this intermediation. Tourmate into this intermediation banking for example, I call myself a middleman. Yeah, I'm a middleman. Why? Because I don't produce anything. Do you? Do you believe me? I don't produce anything. I I take money from those people who have money. We call them depositors. They deposit money into the bank. I pay them 1% interest. OK, you earn 1% interest, so I get the money from those people who have money and then I lend it out. To people who need money. What do we call them? We call them borrowers. Right. And we charge them 3% interest. Right in between, I earned 2% and we call this interest earning or interest spread. So this is a middleman. Right. Today, do we still need this sort of middleman? Not really. In China, I think you is, it's a bit going down now, but we used to have you know the P2P lending right. I think the central government in Beijing started to, you know, close down a. Lot of them, but for quite a while. In China, you don't have to go to the bank to. Borrow money. You can you can borrow money from they. Give you credits. From you know Ali Ali pay and they give you money from, you know, from WeChat. And there are a lot of P2P business. They do direct deals between the people who have money and the people who need money, just directly peer to peer, peer to peer, no banking involved in that. So this middleman function. Is being taken away. By a lot of this new style of business. Peer to peer business. That's not scary enough. The other two are even more scary. You know, disruptions. You know the way. The banks do business in the past. It's very traditional, you know. You have to go to the bank and open an account and then you know in the good old days you even have to go up all the steps. And then I remember. When I opened my first bank account in Hong Kong. I even need to find a reference person. You know you need a a senior person with some social status to sign a letter and. With that letter. I go to the Hong Kong bank or Standard Charter bank and open an account. Today. Not anymore. You know, this sort of old style of banking is being disrupted. You don't need to. I mean, typical example I mentioned already, like Airbnb, right? They don't need a hotel anymore. I mean, my kids, my boys, like your age. They don't stay in the hotel. They stay in Airbnb. They have their own privacy, their own freedom. They don't have to bother about, you know, go going to get a key at the counter and you know all these things. So disruption is another very big impact to banking. The third one is displacement. Not anymore. We need this products or service. I remember a typical example is travellers cheques. I don't think you guys know anything about travellers cheques but our age when we went on a when we go on the holiday. One of the first things. We have to do is what. Go to Thomas Cook. Go to American Express, you know, go and buy a book. Buy several books of travellers cheques, right, so that when you go to London or New York or wherever, we can tie up one piece and then cash it into local currency into into American dollar or British pounds or whatever. That is the time that we have to. Do things like this. Anymore. Of course, you don't even know about it anymore. This is all gone. You know, this is completely replaced by what? By this right. First by credit cards and then by mobile payment by all the electronic payments. So anyway I elaborate a bit too much but but this is these are the 3D's. This intermediation disruption and displacement, now today as banking as banker, what do we do? We try to work with them. We know that we cannot beat them. So we joined them, you know. Hans beat them. Join them. Let's work together. So from 3D's, we are now moving towards what we call 3C's, right? Cooperations. Collaborations and Co creation. We do things together like give you very much. I'll give you many examples. Of that in. The next section. Some of the examples I just highlight some key ones like open bank. As I mentioned before, banks are traditionally very conservative. You know they are, they have doors closed, you need to lock on the door. You need to present a letter to open account today. Not anymore. We're building a banking or financial service ecosystem, not only with banks but also with many other partners. What we call lifestyle service partners Open banking is 1 very major phenomenon and then virtual banks. Hong Kong has has eight of them. What we call virtual banking and they don't have branches, they just do everything online, right, using the phone open account with the, you know with the you know of biometric authentication or talk about that and then digital asset, I'm not here to to try to convince to try to persuade you to do digital currencies. But I'll cover that in a in another section, but that's another major phenomenon. In the past, assets are always physical. My generation, my age, we always believe in physical assets. Gold, you know, silver stocks. Those are physical, in fact, stocks. I even have the whole stack of paper. Paper stocks. You know my wife, for example, she still holds on to all the paper stocks piece of paper to certify that you have that piece, you have that amount of stocks equities. In MTR in raid. Or whatever, right? So nowadays access becoming more digital, more virtual and then another very important thing is the share economy. As I promise I will give you some examples of the use of technology or fintech in the in the business, in the business world. Maybe I go a bit faster. In banking, those are the seven very major functions in the bank, like very much firstly. I talk about mobile only, right? I talk about servicing kinds and products and services only on the mobile phone. So the customer experience this is very important. I talk about mobile only already. We do a lot of products and services. We developed a lot of new products and we use a lots of technology to really develop those products as I mentioned. You know all the seven or eight features of the phone we try to make the make make use of, if not all, most of them. OK. You can talk to the phone. For authentication, you know voice authentication, you can use the voice to help people without the eyesight to do banking services right, transfer money. Making a payment, et cetera. Buying stocks you can talk to it now instead of having to press buttons, things like that. So we are we're using a lot of technology even for the disabled, you know for people without eyes. Right, yeah. People cannot listen, cannot hear so. Using technology for that I go. I don't go through every one of them now because risk management is my top my topic. Joseph knows that, and I I do a lot of risk management research in the compliance space in the the the market risk, credit risk, etc. So it's a lot of, there's a lot of technologies devoted or invested in the risk management function banking. Is there to take risk to make profits. Take risk calculated risk to make profit. And that's the. The headlines of banking. If banks do not take risk, then we only we won't make any money. Right when you lend money to a borrower. He may not. He or she may not be able to repay you. That is a risk we call it credit. Risk. Now, how do you assess that person? The borrower that he or she is going to be able to pay you back what you lend him or her? That is a risk management. Yeah, that's simple as that. The ability to pay back. The money that you lend. And the probability. The ability to pay you back and the probability for not paying you back. So that's the the two factors we time together is the what we call credit risk, yeah. So even hey Charles. You think your child is a boring function. You will be surprised. I mean in our bank. Before we come to see, before we ask you come to for interview, we already know so much about you. I tell I tell you. No kidding. Yeah, he died. So we we go to the, we go to the big data. When the candidate comes to apply for a job. Mostly as seniors, more senior positions. We take up everything about you before we call you up for interview. OK. And that's big data analysis and we do matching profile matching to see whether your profile your background is really suitable for this job. Yeah. And when you come to interview for the first time, we give you a. Sort of like a matter worse sort of environment. Yeah, a simulated environment. You'll be involved. You'll be in a. Room with the virtual reality environment. Where we give you some scenarios as if you are part of it and see how you respond. How you respond to that scenario is almost like matter. Worse, you are involved in it. You're not just sitting here and press buttons. You're part of the game. Like a game. And that's how we interview how we select people, not just profile matching anymore. We give you a simulated environment to see how you react or respond to the various scenarios. If you are applying a job in a call centre or at a branch, we give you as an Environment, HR and talk about human resource department. And see how you respond, how you serve the client when someone is yelling at you. When someone is shouting at you. When someone is almost going to hit you. At the brunch, angry very upset. What do you do? OK. So that's how we apply technology in. All these functions and even the both the most traditional, you know, boring sort of hate child function. We are trying to apply technology to do a better job. This is the my this is the the evolution of the. Human interface, right? The customer experience. From all the branch and branch banking, phone banking, Internet banking, I don't think you know. I don't think you you know as well but it doesn't. Matter. We have thing called SMS Banking, WAP banking in between the phone banking Internet. Now Internet banking is a big thing. You know we started to do things on the big screen. You know like that. You know. Then we have mobile banking. We have now open banking and I'm sure very soon we have what we call the AI banking, you know, artificial intelligence, banking and. All together, we are trying to create a better value for the client for the customer. What we call the customer lifetime value. This is this is kind of microlearning. Only slide. I don't think I don't think. ChatGPT has it yet, but you can try ChatGPT and see chat GPTS you can get this 8I's I call 8 + 1 because I add the last one very late immersive. When we developed. User interface, you know big screen or mobile phone like this. We have what we call the eight eyes principle, right. And you you learn it today here only in this classroom you don't find it in the Internet. The interface has to be informative and insightful. Interesting and enlightening. Interactive and intuitive. Innovative and inspiring. And last but not least, now today with 3.0 is immersive. Now we we have measures on how we achieve these eight. I's you know. We hope that when people. For example, using a phone. Simple example, if you go to our our website our our our app. Give you some examples. How do we transfer money? How do we pay money? From a person A to person B. Now you can use the good old boring stuff. You know you you select the account from and then select the account too, right? So you pay each other you pay from A to B. We don't do that, right? Reject, you know.
We drag a piece of flower.
Or we drag a love letter. From a person to B person as you as if you are sending a message sending a greeting to somebody else. And we can accompany it with a voice script. You know, you can say I love you or I love you. You can record it and then together with the payment, let's say $100, you send $100. Of course, you don't have to type 100, you just scale up and then you it comes to. 100 you drag it across. The money, $100, goes together with a piece of message with a piece of voice recording with a with an emoji or whatever. So that's how we make it more interesting, more game like. So it's not a boring transfer of $100 from account A to account B anymore. Yeah. So how that's how we make it animated. We make it interesting. We make it in writing, make we make it live. Yeah, we make it human like a human experience. You're not paying each other just for paying. You're sending a regard. You're sending a greeting to each other. You're sending your care, your love to each other. Why do you pay someone? Because you care you. You don't care. Why do you pay? Just let him chase me. Just let him chase me. I don't pay. You keep looking on my door. I just ignore you. Why do you pay each other? Because you care for each other. So that's the. That's the 8I's plus one plus the immersive. I'll talk about matter. Words matter, words, banking. Talking about payment, I think Hong Kong, I'm a honker. I'm a Hong Kong person. So although I live a lot of time in, in overseas and in China, but Hong Kong finally caught up. Thank goodness we are. So we are so much behind. But now all of a sudden, if you talk about today, we have so many different payment methods and I think you use you must use some of them like paying me. Et cetera. You know some of the functions that the payment methods now today is quite comprehensive. Now we can pay Bill, we can pay each other, we can pay merchants et cetera. So thank goodness Hong Kong has caught up and. That was the the slide made. You know, after the Chinese New Year, I remember two years ago only two or only one or two payment methods have licc. Pilicy this year, this year we have so many like see methods I mean so that's that's I that's telling because there's so many of them. So almost every single one of those payment methods have functions to allow to let you pay like C. And even banks like the virtual banks, you know, they have like C functions. So you see, I think Hong Kong has come a long way and finally caught up and caught up with, for example, China. In terms of payment, you know when we talk about banking and finance and payment is the is the most important function. And in China, you can see the mobile payment, I think it's leading the world. I'm I'm surprised that Vietnam is second. I I'm I'm not convinced about it. I came. I went to Vietnam only to two months ago. Yes, it's used everywhere. But I think it's still far behind China. But anyway, you see China leading the world in terms of payment, mobile payment and they show us what, what the how people use mobile payment in China in restaurants etcetera. And those are statistics that is quite recent this 2022. Dominant dominant by by two, the the top 295% is quite. Quite amazing. You know, it's dominated by only two players. So these are these are payments that the the first example is the most important function of banking or finance is paid payment #1 #1 function. I talk about a BCD, so I I feel a bit obliged to talk about blockchain, but it's a bit hard for for a class like this to go deep into it. Blockchain is, I think everybody heard about it. It's just like chaining up blocks of data blocks of records and chaining together. Comma audit trail. You know, we in accounting terms, we call it all the. But Hong Kong has by now. Four or five very major projects using blockchain and I'm very pleased to to say that and one of the examples successful example is the etrade Etrade Connect, and that's for trade financing for import export trade financing. You know, when people have to buy things. From manufacturers overseas you you open the LC you know letter of credit or TR's or open accounts. So to complete the the the tray. Source buying from manufacturer and then selling to the consumer. In between there are many many steps and there are many, many parties involved. You know many steps, many steps along the way and many parties like banks like manufacturer, retailers. Wholesaler, you know, insurance company, etcetera, etcetera. These are the typical scenarios for using blockchain. You know, because there are many parties, there are many steps. And there are many documentations many many documents. When you do a trade international trade cross border trade. So this is one of the typical scenario where blockchain, you know because it's an audit trail, right? It's a electronic audit trail to link them audits together now. You can see some of the functions that they are that they are completed by by block by blockchain. I think I don't go deep into it. If you are interested. I have a actually I have a separate set of presentation on blockchain. And I think even in China. Beijing Xi Jinping has has said that China should embrace blockchain and it's a big thing in China as well. Not digital currency per say, digital currency or crypto or bitcoins or. Over it's it's but. Just one example of using blockchain, but otherwise blockchain has many, many real meaningful applications. Another example. I like to share as they use a very typical use of AI's and you know, robots and machine learnings and all these fintechs thing is the. What we call the human machine interface, the call centre. In the past we call it call centre. We started with Web chat and then we have chat. Bots and then. We have global advisors. And it does so many, they do so many things. You know, Robo advisor, it gives you all the advice, all the advice, all the information. About your portfolio, your risk assessment about the performance of your investment portfolio, the equity, the stocks you hold, etcetera. In fact, chances are. When you call up the bank, if you ever call up the bank, I mean, in fact, I seldom call the bank. Now I I don't, I use this. But if you ever call up the bank. Ring up the ring them up. Chances are that you'll be answered by a robot, right? You'll be answered by a robot, and it's through the speech to text, text to speech technology. So when you ask the question to the bank or any other service industry like airlines, in fact I hate it. You know, to be honest, I mean, I really hate it when. You call up Cathay Pacific. Or Hong Kong Express or whatever airlines. You never get to a person, you always get answered by a machine. Yeah, you ask you to do this and do that and really agitating, you know, it's very and it makes you very angry. So that's the the limitation, the sentiment, #4, emotion, sentiment. When someone is already out of patient, that stupid machine will still be just answering you as if you are, you know the dummy. So these are the key issues we have to address in terms of the human machine interface, how do we handle the emotions, the sentiment of the? Colour right or the customer? The other are. The accuracy and the currency, whether it's updated the information is updated or not etcetera. One very important thing about this chatbot. About this, you know human machine interface today. And the knowledge behind it is, of course the main ChatGPT. I use it a lot in fact. I can show you. You know, on the phone how this, how this would change my life. Actually it's it's so powerful. And this is through the you know the. Sometimes you can even talk to it. Otherwise you can key in the data and you have you know it process your. And understand it. And then generate the answer for you from the knowledge base from the database it has. There are many examples. How many of you already using it? Only feel surprise me. How come you how come you guys are a bit slow, is it? You don't have to pay for the week for the for the VPN. Yeah. In Hong Kong you just do like me. Use the PPOE, right. You just download the app. You download PPOE is free of charge. It's free of charge, so you just download it and then you get sage or. So anyway, download Poe and that's that's exactly exactly chat VPT GPT so and you can you can. Learn how these things work and when I talk about the interface human machine interface. That's a typical example of it. And it's so much knowledge now there are some limitations I show you. Oh, by the way, this, this this is like this is a quote I got from the Internet saying that the best way to think about this ChatGPT is that you are chatting with a with an eager to learn intern who sometimes lies to you, sometimes lies to you. It's not always telling the truth because it doesn't know everything. It has limitations and the data, the knowledge that ChatGPT has is up to 20. 21 up to last year, so some of the latest development if you ask the ChatGPT, what's the latest price of Bitcoin? Right. For example, what's the latest price of Bitcoin? It cannot tell you because the data is up to last year. But if you ask question or this is the uptake and you are you guys are most of you guys are not one of those but you can see that it takes Spotify. You know the music, the app 150 days. To go up to 1,000,000 users and Instagram takes about 75 days to get to the million user ChatGPT takes 5 days to get 1,000,000 users and many of you are not one of those. But this is the typical answer. If I ask just to prepare for this presentation. I asked the question how is the Fintech changing the world? Yeah. And these are the answers from ChatGPT. Right. Six bullet points very well explained. I don't do any editing, it's just exactly the raw answer from jet from jet jet. GPT. If you have this question as your. You know, project work, project exercise or you know class class work. You can go to cheque, GBT and type in these questions from from professor and then you all got the same. Answer for him. Right. Quite well structured, quite well written. Every single bullet point is very it's very valid. You know I like them. Very comprehensive answer. I don't think I can add #7, to be honest. Maybe I can if I spend a bit of time I can add #7 number #8 but it's giving me the 1st 6 already. OK. So University of Hong Kong, for example, has decided to ban students from using the ChatGPT to do the homework to the project works. Because you can ask anything and it comes up very well answered very good answers. However, it's got its limitations and I try another question just for fun. I try many questions actually, but I try another question and then you give me very silly answers. What should I send to my? Girlfriend on Valentine's Day. It gave me 55 suggestions right? Here are the few ideas to help you. Get started, blah blah blah blah blah. I bet you if I did that, my wife will be will be very upset. So because I've done all these five already, so I need to number I need #6 #7 in order to to please her. So this is wisdom, by the way. I give you one. I give you one example just for fun. I mean how how are we doing on time? Quite, quite many years ago we went to Singapore to visit a friend right to visit some friends and I I just came back from Singapore. Yes.
And we were exhausted, exhausted. We ate so much. You know, every every time when you go out, visit a friend, we go for dinner. So after four days, we will stop. You know we, we we don't want to eat anymore. We have indigestion and we don't want to eat anything.
Every day, just lunch and dinner and lunch and dinner. And then. We said OK, forget it. And then that was a Valentine's Day. So if I beat any of this. You know. Go for dinner. You know, plan a romantic dinner. I think I think she'll be quite upset. So you need wisdom. You don't need just knowledge. You don't need ChatGPT. You need something clever, really human human wisdom. And guess what I did right? So I I if I send her a bunch of roses, she'll be upset because I'm spending too much money. Right. Too expensive to buy that bunch of roses. Anyway, Long story short, at the end I you went to something very different and you went to something very wise, very wise. We went to a social dance club that happened. I know. So we had a beautiful dancing night together. Two of us and very intimate, very romantic. And then we. We burned all our fat. You know, we burn all our energy, we we, we we we exercise a lot in order to finish all the things all. The food that we eat. So that is that is something that the ChatGPT would not suggest me. Yeah, the AI would not have that wisdom. To suggest me to have a bit of an exercise, you know, to dance around for one night. And that is very, very memorable. Human wisdom. Another example is open banking. I already talked about it. Banks are not just close themselves. To do banking anymore, we open it. Up this is. The old paradigm when you do banking, you, you you go to the branch or you download a banks apps. You know the bank's mobile app or you go to the bank's website to get services. That's how we used to do for for decades. You know, for the past many, many years today, you don't do, you don't need that anymore. In fact, I remember when I went to CB. China Construction Bank in Shenzhen and I asked them for a token, you know, the the OTP one time password tokens and I and then the and the lady said, oh, Michael, you don't need to do that anymore. Many people don't even download the banks apps anymore. You can go to WeChat. You know you can go to weijin and you can. You can do a lot of the banking functions, you know with China Construction Bank with directly on the on the on the WeChat, WeChat banking. WeChat is where WeChat is here, right? So you don't need to go to the bank or banks Internet website or mobile apps to do banking anymore. You go to WeChat. So you go to all the partners, the ecosystem. Partners to receive banking services. And banks becoming open. You know for business. So we have a thing called banking beyond banks because even WeChat, for example or price.com or open rice in Hong Kong or you know airlines. Can offer some kind of banking services, balance, enquiry payment, even transfer can be done on a third party on a third party app. You don't need to do bank directly with the banks, so banking beyond banks and banks beyond banking, because banks are also partnering with all these service providers and offering. Services more than just traditional banking. Yeah, we talk. We just talk about CBD and those of you from China know that they have seen Shenyang, Chang, Chang Chang. You can go to CCB's website or CCB's app to even buy a. Fridge, you know. To buy air ticket to book your car. To a car rental. On the CCB China Construction Bank's website so they can sell things more than just banking products now, so bank be banks beyond banking and banking beyond banks is the. The headlines for the open banking ecosystem. I already talk about this. A bit so I can probably skip that. I work for. China CITIC Bank before and we were the first. Ever bank in Hong Kong to offer? Remote account opening and that was wow five years ago already. Five years ago, we became the first bank that you can open account for the first time without going to the branch. You just use the phone. You can be anywhere. In the world to open an account with the.
And that was a breakthrough. Yeah, that was a complete breakthrough. Took me about 1 1/2 years, almost 1 1/2 years to convince the regulator that we don't need customers to go and see us physically face to face, to open account and we break. We break through so many things. No address proof. For example, biometric. I already talked about the live cheques and all these things. Facial facial recognition. And verify the Hong Kong ID and the passport. Now you may, you may. You may sound easy, but to do it for the first time, it's very hard to convince the regulator. It's very hard. Yeah. So. And no branch visit ever. So we had this ten major breakthroughs in order to achieve the remote account opening. OK, without going to the banks anymore. And today, based on this remote account opening that we did. I almost used the word I, but you know we have a team to convince the regulator. With that, with that solid bases, then we Hong Kong have 8 virtual banks now and they all do the same thing. Maybe the technology has evolved has evolved a bit, but otherwise the same concept using the mobile phone using all the seven or eight features of the phone to open account for new customers for new customers. And these are the eight banks the 8 virtual banks. They offer services entirely on the on the mobile phone, on the Internet. The problem is that they they're not making money. How come you didn't come up? Anyway, they they're not making money yet in Hong Kong. Because of some limitations, one of the limitation is that you have to be Hong Kong, Hong Kong person. You have to have Hong Kong ID's or Hong Kong company to be a customer. OK, so that is a limitation, so only 7,000,000. And most of the 7 million people in Hong Kong already have accounts elsewhere, so that they have a pretty tough situation to deal with. Another as a banker, I have to mention that regulatory technology regulatory technology is called REGTECH and. Banks are taking risk. Remember what I said earlier? If you do not take risk, we don't make money. But to take risk means what? You know, you may lose customers deposit. You borrow money, you take money from the depositor, lend it out to the borrower. If that guy cannot repay, cannot pay you back, then you are in trouble. You know, bank runs out of money. So risk management is one thing. Now my focus in my research is more on the financial crimes and as an example how we use technology. Just give you example, this taken out from one of my pick. In my other set, we got to know the customer. We got to know more about the customer. Can that guy pay me back? You know, he, he he borrow money from the bank. Can he pay it back? Can we pay me back? So we have to know that borrower more, right? That's sort of know your customer KYC, know your customer and how do we know the customer I talk, I talk about HR, right? I talk about human resource department when you come to apply for a job. We got to know you. We got to profile you. We gotta test you in a matter worse environment. Yeah. How you respond to angry customers, for example, right know your customer KYC very important and that's my research topic. Now, how do we know the customer? We know we gotta find out the identity, a demographic we know about. We gotta find out credit and financial background. We gotta find out your relationship in the society. Occupation, your behaviour. Your transactional behaviour, we gotta know about your social and reputation, whether you are a dangerous person, whether you have a very, very bad name already on Facebook or on QQ, right? So we find out everything about you. Do do your friends like you, you know? Do you have a lot of enemies? A lot of people who don't like you, so we we find out everything. In order to decide whether we lend money. To that person. Right. That is the process we go through. From the beginning, when you open account all the way in the relationship, every single transaction that will count just like in China, thing Chung, right, Zhang Jingjing we know you social behaviour, financial behaviour and that's the research that I do and that's how we make use of technology. To do all this, and in my research I use I use machine learning. To decide are depending on different kinds of customers, whether it's individual customer or company, customer, corporate, we apply different machine learning methods or models to find the best fit for that type of customer. Different machine learn there. There are dozens of machine learning. Models. I think you learn of something like the season trees, right? The season tree. Does it ring a bell? Random forest? Neural network. So we use we use different methods to decide how to determine whether you are a good customer or bad customer. OK. That's how we use technology. Again, as I said, I I research into it, I spend a lot of time on it. I can talk for another two hours just on that single topic. How we use artificial intelligence on know your customer or or AML anti money law. Perhaps this will be the last one I talked about in terms of example, if you're like, if you guys live in Hong Kong, you better sign up. For I I am smart. I think you can right. Even you're from China as long as you're a Hong Kong citizen, a Hong Kong resident, you can apply for Hong Kong. I'm smart and even in banks now we can open accounts with. I'm smart. So all I talk about, you know, facial recognitions and remote account opening and shake your head and bring your eyes and open your mouth and all. You don't need. You don't. Need to do that anymore? If you have, I am smart and banks are now like Bank of China. It's a longer list. I just chop it off. But you can now use I am smart. Once you have signed up for, I am smart in Hong Kong. You can open accounts directly using. I'm smart as the authentication, as as the as the proof of your identity. So that's another breakthrough in Hong Kong. Yeah, applying. I'm. I'm smart for banking. OK, you can move on. The the third topic is blockchain cryptocurrency and digital asset. As I said, this is the May. This is another major change in in the banking world. Using blockchain, as I mentioned already chains of blocks. Chains of blocks of data or or information or records. And one of the key features is that it cannot be changed. It's like a permanent audit trail. Yeah, permanent records of what happened. So that's very important. It's in, in English, it's called immutable. OK cannot be changed and that's why it's trustworthy. And that's why we're saying that putting putting. Putting trust in an in an untrusted Internet. OK. Another important sort of spin off from the blockchain. Now, by the way, blockchain is unchangeable and you may ask why. I think you read about it already or I'm talking. I'm telling you something you already know. Is that when? You create a chain, a block chain. It's like a chain of rings, right? Connected together. And if you have just one chain. Then you can be changed. You can you own the chain. You may, you know, you may tamper it. You may change it. You may do anything. You like, but the the whole premises of blockchain is that that chains of blocks or records or data is copied.
Thousands of times, thousands of you know millions of times, so it's everywhere, all around the world. So it's just like you make a photocopy of one piece of paper or one document. You have one copy of that document. So you can change it. You know you can just alter it, you can just change whatever you like on the copy. But imagine when you make that copy, there are millions of other people also get a copy of that document. Can you change all the 1,000,000 copies? Very hard. Because because that millions of copies already accepted. By those other guys, right? As even if you change your copy. There's still so many of them out there that is not changed yet. And you say I I want to change it. People say no. Why do you want to change it? Why? Why do you want to change it? It's already good. Already accepted already. You know file already documented. So you can't change it. So that's the promises. Of the blockchain cannot be changed now that has good things and also that has bad things sometimes make it very difficult. To to to work where you cannot change, but in most cases it's good because it's a. It's a true trust trustworthy record. Another spin off from the blockchain is smart contracts. Now, smart contract is like you know, and you sign a contract. You know you have a commercial deal or you buy a buy a house. There is a piece of paper you sign at the law firm with the lawyer, with the conveyancing and then you sign it. That's it. Finish. No change. But the world may change. The environment may change, right? There could be a war. There could be a COVID. You know, there could be a a, you know, Hong Kong, you know, closed down. For three years. Right. So something doesn't work anymore if you have a a you if you rent a a shop, then the shop will be will be no business for three years because of COVID. Then you ring up the the. You ring up the landlord and say, hey, I have no business. You know, every day no income. Can I return? You know, can I hand you back the key? You know, I don't want to rent it anymore. Or can you give me some discount on the rental? No, no, no, cannot. Because that's the piece of paper you have to pay this money. This. Much money every day. Smart contract allows you the flexibility to adapt the contract. Depending on the environment, the the circumstances. Right. It's all a piece of programme. It's not a piece of paper anymore. It's a piece of programme rather than a piece of paper. And the programme was designed. And developed in such a way that you can adapt it to the changes in environment. OK, that's why it's smart. It changes the contract itself, changes with the environment and that's pre programme. As a condition in the in the smart contract. This is today a bit sensitive. I'm not going to tell you I'm not going to sell you Bitcoins and Eva and. All this because. It's very dangerous. That's the first type, what we call the speculative sort of cryptocurrency. I don't know how many of you actually have. **** have have bitcoins. Do you still have Bitcoin in your pocket in your wallet? I have but. Thank goodness I I saw many of them. I use metal. I use metal pot and I use metal metal. Metal masks and. But I sold most of them now. At a loss. But Bitcoin, when I bought it, it was around $3030.30 something thousand U.S. dollars. Today I think probably is around 20. If you're lucky, it was as low as 16,000 Bitcoin. But remember, big Bitcoin was one 60,000, you know, 66 zero thousand U.S. dollars Bitcoin. Yeah, corn, it's not a corn. Right. It's not. There's no physical beacons. There's no physical Bitcoin. Bitcoin is just a digit in your in your phone, right? So so it goes up and down like. A yoyo, you. Know it could be 60 and it could be 16. So it's your, it's. It's like gambling. So that's the first type and there are many, many big, many, many cryptocurrencies. The second type is a bit boring. It's called stable coin. Stable. So it's supposed to be packed one to one. One big coin, one coin. Stable coin like usdc USDT etcetera is one U.S. dollar, so they're stable pack packing, mapping one coin, one U.S. dollar or one one coin equals one. A piece of gold. Or one formula. So there are three types of stable coins, but I'm not going into details about it. It is. Hard, hard dollar. A commodity and all. The latest FTX fiasco is packed to the coin is packed to a formula. Not a piece of gold, not a U.S. dollar. It's a formula. OK, that's very dangerous. And that's why the the latest incident about FTTX is because it's tagged to a formula. OK, so that's supposed to be stable anyway. Supposed to be. The third type is the most boring. It's not even cryptocurrency, in my view. It's the central government's central coins. This right? Digital currency from the government, from the Central bank. This has no difference to the money notes you have in your wallet, except they don't print it anymore. Yeah. At the moment you pull out your, your wallet and then. You get a. Dollar card. You get, you get a note, right? This is the the money you have, right? This is this is you have. What it means? The third type, Central Bank's digital currency, is that they don't waste this piece of paper anymore. They don't waste this piece of paper anymore. They just put it directly into your wallet. There's no difference. So that's of course very stable. Absolutely stable. Yeah, one to one for sure, because it's issue by the central bank. Except it don't print it anymore now. Is it a digital currency? It is because it's digital. But is it anything else? No, it's just for payment. Especially for cross border payment. When China wants to pay, you know. You know. Middle East for the oil. So instead of in the banking system. We meet millions or billions of dollar to Middle East, to Saudi Arabia or Iran. Yeah, they said. Ohh I don't have to go through the banking system to pay you the $1,000,000 or billion dollar. They say I give you this, I give you the electronic version of this money. Directly through the two crypto or digital systems. Yeah. So no money transfer. You don't have to go through the traditional swift, you know, to change to, to change money, any to, to move money anymore. Now at the moment the swift system, they establish Internet interbank transfer, Swift is the global money transfer network. But that money transfer network is controlled by America, by the US and most of the transactions are in U.S. dollars. So that's why she mianheng. With this digital version of this, we don't need to rely on the SWIFT network anymore between countries between the two banks, we exchange directly using the digital money. OK. So the American, the Americans are very worried.
The latest I add the even using octopus, but the The funny thing. Is that if? You read the sideline of this, this news. Up till two days ago. Only 300 people have signed up, so I think only 300 something people have signed up for this. Even they give you $200.00 of of subsidies. And I I haven't done that yet myself, but I will. So I use octopus. There's the app, you know, the Octopus app. If you have download the Octopus app, you can cross. You can do it in Hong Kong, but when you cross the border, they right away credit you another ¥200. Yeah, bonus for you to start using that app. OK. And with that app, you can start paying so you don't have to pay, you don't have to use WeChat pay or Alipay, you can use octopus for people in like Hong Kong, yeah or otherwise you can use Alipay or WeChat pay and use the E you know EM RMB. Digital rememb. I think I move a bit faster here. Well, this is how how coins are are done in the Bitcoin, but I think I'll skip that because it's a lot of changes in the in the crypto world like. Prove proof of work to proof of stake and it's a major change of concept. Or or either or. All these other crypto you have to work hard to get. To mine it, you know, call Miner right. You have to mine it with a lot of computer. A lot of electricity to burn in order to extract the bitcoins from the algorithm. You know from. The Bitcoin algorithm big virtual is all digital, so this call proof of work you work very hard or some people. The miners, you know, the Bitcoin miners. Huang Gong right Hai Quang Hai Quang. To get the coins out from the computer. Today, the concept has changed to call proof for steaks. You need to prove that you have the coins. In order to have it appreciate in value, it's not just work hard. Is also have to prove that you have owned. You have owned that con for a certain period of time in order to get the credit and to appreciate in value. That's why we call green coins. It's not just burning computer power, burning electricity. To get the coins anymore. So that's a shift. Now many things like this happening in the crypto world and I I I will not talk about it anymore, but I in my research I I look at the KYC, I look at anti money laundering and this is a big problem for me. For for for anti money laundering. Why? Because all these coins have no names. Seemingly without the real person's name. The wallet I have, one of them is still my mother's name. Yeah, it's still under my mother's name because when I started it, when I years ago, they didn't ask me for any proof. So I just chose the name. You can call it McDonald's. You know, you can go it. Kentucky fried. Chicken doesn't matter. You know they don't cheque. So the cons? Anybody can own it. That is the problem. Without the real name. One problem, the other thing is that there's no central government control. Yeah, the it's not regulated. So for the bad guys, for the bad people. Drugs, you know? You know, all sort of bad things, gambling and all this. They can use this cryptocurrency to pay each other to settle the payment. So that's why it's very dangerous because it's no name, no real name. OK. So you see a lot of problems with that. Yeah, in, in your news, you can every now and then you you read, you read this sort of news and when you look at the the price board, you know it's quite scary. You know, it goes up and down all. The time and it's crazy. As I said today, I think Bitcoin is around. Around 200, around 20, around 20 something thousand U.S. dollars. The one thing, as I said, is not regulated. There's no all this Bitcoin or cryptocurrency exchanges. You know, just like money exchange, right? It seems larger. In TSP you have lots of those things and in some one right you have lot of those. It's just the same deal. You can change Bitcoin, you can change to another crypto. There's so many of there's so many cryptos there about, you know, at least in Hong Kong, you can change about 3-4 dozens of cryptos. Cryptocurrencies. But of course the biggest one is is Bitcoin. Everybody knows better peak Bitcoin, but there's so many others. And you can see the prize board. There's so many of them you can change and you can speculate. Some goes up, some goes down. You can just playing with currency. But those things are not regulated. No government control. So that's why beginning of last month, I think the Hong Kong government has started to look at this virtual virtual currency virtual asset exchange platforms and started to put some rules. You know some regulations against them and hopefully with some government. This sort of Bitcoin cryptocurrency business will behave a bit better and hopefully they will do more KYC, you know more know your customers, find out more about the customers before they do business with them. Now that's the only way to make the crypto business. That's an important part of the financial system, you know, because you can't ignore them. They are quite big. There are hundreds of billions of dollars. In that markets, you know the market market. Cap is huge. Although it's still small comparing to the entire financial system, there are about some. 3 or 4% at the moment, but there's still a lot of people involved in that Bitcoin or cryptocurrency business, so the governments in Hong Kong and many other government in the world are looking seriously at how we regulate it. China take a very simple approach. They just ban it, right? Trying to just completely bans all the cryptocurrencies except their own right? The central government, the third type, right. The third type. The government controlled Bitcoin. Government controlled crypto. So this is I just want to mention that because it's a very important development in the financial, in the financial system, the the digital asset and and cryptocurrency. I move on to the 4th topic. NFT metalworks and Web 3.0 that this will be. Something more interesting to you because you may have played with it. How many of you have actually been to the NFNFT? Yeah. Good. Hmm. Not many of you are just too shy to to raise. Your hands and. Now NFT is gone a bit down now, but when I. Put up this slide. It's not very. It's not very. It's actually very recent, it's 2020, this is 2023, January. So China. Even last month, you know in January they're still talking about NFTS? The non fungible tokens. At one stage I think only. Last year was still very, very hot. And this is like a hype. You know, it's sort of gone up like crazy and then started to drop down. Typical example. It was. It was. In fact, I I as a banker, I also look at it and I thought, hmm, interesting. Why are they? Why are they worth? So much money. It's a piece of art or a piece of game, or it's a avatar. It's a weapon, or it's a face, and you can mean it into a. A digital. Token right? And then. The value is actually a perceived value. The famous example is the real value like Neil Armstrong when he made the first step on the moon right? He said, you know, a small step of mine is a giant step of mankind. Now, NASA. Issue that. That little video I think it's about just about few seconds. I mean 5 seconds video. It's a. Digital image, right? It's a video. It's not a physical stuff like a phone. It's just just a a video clip. And they mint it into they make it into an EFT and that was sold for, you know, millions of dollars. Yeah, because someone will would think would believe that when I owned that video as an NFT, there's only one in the world and it was issued by NASA, by the US NASA. So you got to have some value. Right, typical example. And you can mean anything you can mean your own little NFFT of your you know your pet. You know your dog, your cat. I mean, you just think that people will love it. Now, whether it's really carrying that much value is anyone's guess. So it's like a bit of a a gambling, a bit of betting. Because it's only one, then it's scarcity. It's only one or only 100. Now. My the bank. I work, I work for, we have we spin off a separate entity.
To do this sort of NFT business. Yeah, we minted about half a dozen series, about 6-7 series of NFTS. But to be honest. It's very difficult. To make money because the value goes up and down even worse than bitcoins.
So here's proof of ownership, but not proof of rights. It's a digital. Sometimes there's one series we make. It's not. Just a digital. It's not just a video or game or weapon or face or avatar or or pie. Art. One series we made ties together with the physical asset. Now that has a bit different meaning. So if you are a famous artist. You have 10 paintings, real paintings, real picture, OK. You can mean you can produce the NFT, which is digital, which is just virtual things in the computer. You can tie that or bundle it together with the real picture with the real painting. So when someone bit on the NFFT and obtained the NNT, he also owns that real physical painting. So we bundle the virtual, the digital and the physical together. That becomes meaningful. It becomes more meaningful. OK, now you don't have to take that piece of painting real picture back home. There's a thing called custodian service, right? So you can leave that piece of painting the real picture in a custody. Yeah, in a safe deposit place. But that piece of paint painting is yours and you can sell it again and again. Again, to make more money. Yeah, you can change hands. That painting can change hands with the NFFT many times. So that's what we call digital certificates for physical assets. OK, they can be auctioned. They can go up in price. Or go down, of course. And you can trade it. Etc etc. But you can see there are many NFTS in those days. It's some crazy, you know, really crazy and. The NFTS sold for 60, nine, $70 million and even higher than that. How to mint aft? I I in my previous presentation on NFT I actually show the the examples how we actually mean the NFT. It's very simple, in fact, I I'm maybe just too shy to raise to raise your hands, but if you go to sandbox, you go to, you know, open sea. These they actually teach you how to do it. In fact, you just follow the steps and you have a GPAC, you have a, you have a GPAC file, you have an image file and then you have a game or whatever. You just post it. My my daughter in law meant about half a dozen of them, and she likes all the jewelries, you know, all the all the girly stuff and necklace and all. This remained into NFT and to show people that, you know, I have these, these things and people like it, her friends actually bid on it. I don't understand this girly stuff, but but they they have these fantasies of. Myself, owning that piece of jewellery. Yeah, even it's virtual. OK, so it's very simple. I don't I don't. I don't cover that anymore because you may find it a bit. Boring. Now, if you have done it already. Another thing is the matter worse and how how we do it in banking. I'll cover that briefly. Now what is matter? Worse matter worse is beyond and after universe and matter. So the the first one in fact already some 810 years ago, I was one of the first to get into matter words because I I'm member of the second line. I don't know if Joseph, you have heard of second life and is the 10 years ago already have second life and in second life is a game. You live like a real person in a real environment. Of course it's a simulated, but it's on a computer screen, yeah. We didn't use all the goggles and virtual realities and all this yet, but on the screen you have the environment where you live. And in matter words in second life, I was a medical doctor. I act like a medical doctor in second life. As a game. And you actually behave like a medical doctor and you ask me why I? Signed up as a medical doctor because that was the year my second son, my my younger son. Got into medical school. Trained himself as a doctor so as a father. I want to learn. I want to have a bit of experience how a medical doctor behaves and and go through the study. So that was me and I, I, I quit. I quit second life by now. But there are many of them now, sandbox and decentral lands, et cetera is what we what we now call Web 3.0. Web 2.0 You still have a screen in front of you and the only interface. It's the keyboard, right? You're you're you're using the interface. Or maybe the maybe the camera and you are having a distance between me. And the computer, there's a distance. There's a gap between the two of you, and the only interface are the keyboards or the microphone or the camera. Et cetera. 3.0. Is the word. Remember I talked about the H + 1 I's the the last I is immersive. Yeah, you are part of it. You are no longer, you know, just touching the keyboard. You are. You are feel like part of the whole thing. So that's the better words. It's immersive. It's interactive. Yeah, it's 3D. So it's a completely new experience. And it's also community based. You are in there, you will live together, you work together, you learn together, you play games together, you socialise and go to pub. And there are banks in the matter. Words there are medical clinics and hospitals in the metal words, there are law firms in the metal works. They're all boutique shops in the metal works. You know, Prada. You know. All the famous brands are in there now, you know. So it's like a parallel world. Away from the real world. And that's what is happening now. In the matter words, and you can play games there. I don't need to play any of those games. You can have entertainment. You just see too many of. Them and you can live there like whoever you like to be as an avatar, right? You can. I was the medical doctor. But you can be anything else in a matter. Worse, you just behave like that. You just live like that. You can have all the exhibitions, one of the one of the series of NFT's we meant in our in our subsidiary is actually put on a on a on a virtual gallery gallery. Right, you can you can, you can go. Into the metre work with your Google with your virtual reality. Your mixed reality, your augmented reality. You know ARMR XR VR or whatever. And you you feel like you're just walking along the around the gallery and see all the virtual arts. And they are as good as the real ones. But. Even better than the real ones. So this is the gallery experience and. And you can watch movies. In fact, I dare say the movie industry. The Hollywood's. Are the 1st. Matter. Words, pioneers. Although you are watching a movie, it's not immersive. You're not immersive, but at least you can. You can experience the the this the feeling of a matter worse, even though you're not part of it. You're just audience sitting here, watching the movie matter. Worse is going in there directly as part of it. But the concept of metal works is already the first time nearby Hollywood. Yeah. Ready Player 1, right? Anyone. Watch that right. Matrix, et cetera. Those are all metal words concept movies. Real estates. Right. As I said, even MTR has bought a piece of land in the matter words, it's no difference to a real piece of land. You can you have no money to buy, you know. A property on the peak in Hong Kong. You know, too expensive. Billions of dollars for you. But you can buy a piece of land at the same address. In the matter words. You can buy Hollywood Rd #9. And you can pay a price, which is maybe a little bit of money and you can occupy that big, that big piece of land in the matter worse in Hong Kong. Right. Now you said it's crazy. Why do I buy a piece of land in the matter words? Why? Well, speculations, you're looking, you're hoping that next to you next door to you will be another famous person. Who becomes your neighbour, you know? You have a no name brand, but if suddenly you find yourself within the neighbourhood in the matter, words full of Elvis and producers and Louis buttons, and you know all these famous brands around you, your piece of land becomes. Becomes valuable. So that's why people buy lands in the matter words. One reason another reason is actual use of it. Yeah, if you are you want to run a hospital or run the law firm in matter words. Now you think I'm crazy, but there are lot of litigations in the matter. Words a lot of people suing each other. Just like the real world. You take my intellectual property. I sue you. So they need lawyers. And then the question is what law? There's no law, there's no laws in the matter. Words as yet. But sometimes there may be laws. There may be laws in the matter words to Gulf to to regulate, you know, to to regulate this sort of. Disputes, you know, cases in the matter, words. So you ask me, they are famous companies now buying lands and metalworks and business. Even banks, for example, and Hang Seng Bank is not alone. At least four banks now have their branches in the metal works in sandbox in the central lands. And you say it's crazy why banks bother about setting up branches in in metalwoods. But in matter words, they need to pay each other. Right, they need to pay each other when you win a game, when you lose a game, you need to settle, settle money. OK. And that's of course using cryptocurrencies, it's not the US dollar, it's not the Hong Kong dollar. Yeah. And they even issue NFT's for the little products, you know, for the NFT product, for the metal words products. Universities where educations. That is you. Probably hasn't got that yet, but but UST has. Open the Mathworks campus and Pauline you has opened, the has launched the Metal Works education. So for example. Hong Kong you. When they admit it, when they admit the new student to the medical school. A bit similar to what I said about hiring new employee new staff. The Hong Kong U Medical school actually let the new students year one new students go through the metal works experience with the Google with the real simulator environment and see what their did the the new students like. Now my younger boy actually gone through that, so I know. For example, take a simple example. Some students or some new students. They may be excellent in academic scores, right? But it may be very poor in terms of the emotions in terms of the the human skills. So they test you in the matter words, just like what I said. You know, when you are dealing with a difficult patient, a very grumpy, very grumpy person, what do you do? And another example, there's there are kids who are afraid of butts, for example. You know, some young girls, they may get scared, you know. When they see blood. So they get through this experience. They know that art, this, this, this student scares, you know, it's afraid. It's afraid of blood. But in the matter worse they test you and they collect the data and they know that this particular student has this sort of problems or issues and then they they focus on that to address that. When they are meet new students into the medical school. So that's the matter worth campus and that's the matter worth programme, that each of the students. Has to go through. Right. So that is an example of harm. There are many things that you cannot do. In real life. But you can do it in the matter worse. If you're training a pilot, one of my friends are now going through the pilot training in Cathay Pacific. It's like simulators, but in the past the simulator is like a simulator. You have a steak and then you, you, you, you, you play with the computer. The new matter words concept of pilots pilot training is that you are in there. You're actually driving a plane in the world in the and you test your response. You test your, you cannot crash a plane into a mountain in real life. But in matter worse you can. You can. They actually let you crash a plane. Or simulate the crash of the plane. Yeah. And how you behave or landing on water, how you how you behave, how you land on water with the plane. So that's the the the the education part of it. And Hong Kong, you the matter was alumine land. You know, they open a piece of land in in sand in the central land. Yeah, in Decentraland and Alumnis can socialise, can socialise each other in this matter worse land. But the problem is that again it's like NFT. It goes up and down. Yeah. So what we call vodka now. You you heard the news that the better or Facebook actually we change 11111 thousand workers in that day we in that matter was division and even the 10. Rent also disband the exile, the the, the extended reality business team. So there's a lot of uncertainty in the in this sort of NFT or cryptocurrency or metal words. But today I introduced them to you because it's very important part of of our. You know, technology, business evolutions, you know. Just like ChatGPT. Yeah, you have to know about it. You have to be. You have to get involved in it. And by all means, download Poe. Yeah. Download Poe and experience that. Would it be there forever? Just like NT? Probably not. But you get you get this as part of the evolution. A lot of things gonna happen and. It's called vodka, right? I think you heard about this volatility uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. I think these 4 letters word Boca. Summarises what we are experiencing today. A lot of uncertainty. I don't know what matter. Worse is going to be like in the future, but at the moment we all get to learn a. Bit about, yeah. I think I'll skip this and maybe when I talk about four letters words I share with you, a few of those 4 letters words that I like a lot. Just like Walker, yeah, volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, ambiguity. *****. You know you don't. You don't. Really see whether it's left or right, or whether it's bright. Or dark. You don't see that it's ambiguous. I'll share with you a couple of these 4 letters word like core. It's very important for the digital age we have today. The first letter C. Now this is again only in this class. I don't think you can find this in ChatGPT at all or on Internet at all. And if you missed that, then you missed it. The first letter is curiosity. I think it's very important if you are not, if you. Do not have a. Curious, mind you, miss out a lot of things in this digital world in this digital age. Now I'm not criticising my wife, but I mean she's she's just like that. I buy her a new phone. In fact, I just bought her the the iPhone 14, right? Brand new opened the box and you? Know what she asked me? My dear, make sure I can still watch the. You know. The TVB operas right I can still open my. You know, famous the the movie The the video she loves, you know, all the things she used to do with her old phone. Of course, I said. Rest assured, I'll get them all pulled over to you, to the new phone, but the the mindset is a bit. Tricky, right? Because she's only looking at it as a. As a tool for her to continue doing what she does all the time. It's a gong. It's a gonggi. It's a it's a gong boy. It's a tool. It's a gong goy. Now what I'm looking for you guys, when you get a new gadget, whatever, doesn't matter. But like for example, a phone. I hope that you have the curiosity you have a curious mind. To explore. What this new phone will give me? Yeah, you explore. What are the new functions and what are the new features? Of this new phone. You treat it as a a toy. Quan Chi won going rather than Gong going, you know it's a it's a big difference between the mindset. Of a tool. Versus a toy when you see as a toy, you play with it. You try to find some new things about it. So that is curiosity, the first letters word or creativity, and then all is open mind. Open mind. You have to keep an open mind. Don't take things for granted. Alright, of course. I mean, there are things that you may challenge me. Ohh the sun. Goes up in the east. And sat and sat down in the West. OK, OK. I don't dispute with you. I mean, the sun comes up on the east and set goes. Down in the West. Well, live in this part. Of the world, that's all. I mean the. The east is Pacific Ocean. Is it so? It comes up on the Pacific Ocean. It sets down on the Atlantic Ocean. OK, fine. As we live in this. Part of the world. But remember, if you look up the map, there's a place in the world called Panama, and there's a little curve like that. You know that if you talk about the water, it actually goes up on the Atlantic Ocean. It settles on the Pacific Ocean because it's just the. OK, so if you want to go into argument that could be an argument. It doesn't always come up on the Pacific Ocean. So keep an open mind. Things may change. Many things may not be as you think you know as you believe. Risk is important risk preparedness as I as I said, banking is to take risk to make profit, take calculated risk to make profit. And and foresee some energy. If you want to start something new, you have to have the passion. You know you have the passion, passion to do it. You have the enthusiasm and energy to do it. Another 4 letters word are used. A lot is care. You have to talk to people. Communication connexion in China is called guanxi. Yeah. You have to have the guanxi guanghui. You know to. To establish your network and you have the affinity, friendliness, affability to build connexion, to build the the, the friendships, OK, you have to be you. Have to have. Resolve the determination, the the the decisions. To resolve the energy to do it, and then the emotion and empathy, I read this book some years ago by this lady author, you know Karen Perkins and the very good, very powerful book. It talks about emotional power, the soft power. Whereas the core earlier is more hard power and care is more the soft power, the emotion. The communications etc. Think it's ABC DEI? Think actively. Think big, think creatively, et cetera. And this is another 4 letters word I like a lot. It's called luck. Again, this is only Michael. I don't think you can find it anywhere on the Internet. I haven't posted on the Internet anyway. We have a lot of luck. The fact that you're sitting here, you're coming to Hong Kong to study here at the universities is also a bit of luck. And I have a lot of luck. I have my share of luck in my career, otherwise I wouldn't be standing here in front of you. But I also read luck as a different meaning. The four letters word. L stand for locale. In Chinese, in Cantonese, it's called Titan. Cheating. Cheating. You know you don't know where you belong. Cheating, you know. That's very important. So you know where you belong. If you're a Hong Kong person. Your age will you go and study agriculture? Will you go and study mining? I don't think so, right, Hong Kong. Where we are the. Location is A is a business city. Is A is a one of. The major international commercial or financial centre. So quite likely you go into a study for that direct in that in that direction, right going study business study, banking, study finance. You know, study tourism, for example. So know where you are, where you belong. You are as tall as Yao Ming. You know 77 foot. Will you go and learn weightlifting? No. Come on. Learn basketball, right. Learn volleyball. So you know you belong to the basketball court. You belongs to the. So know where you are, know where you belong. Now that you know where you belong, the next thing to do is to learn the rule of the game, right? Understand how to become a good basketball player player right if you're so tall, play basketball. Learn the rule of the game. So understand the rule of the game. What what it takes to be successful. To in playing basketball, for example. And see. It's like once again communications and contacts. So build your friends around that circle. Yeah, if you are really into basketball like Yao Ming, so build a French, build the network, build the people, talk to them, understand how it works. Go into a, go into. A a club. You know my my younger boy is a marathon runner. He runs with many, many of his running mates in a in a running club. So that's how he's successful. So you build networks communications. And last but not least, knowledge you know, just while you're here, do Am's do a master's degree, learn the rule of the, learn the knowledge, the skills. To do that, so that's the proper training educations. How to do it, how to get there? Now when you get these 4 letters alright you LUCK, then you get a number. If you multiply them together you get a pretty good #1000 a million or whatever you get it all right, but importantly. You raise it. To the power I. As an exponential. I I call it integrity. We have seen too many, too many examples. Especially, I'm sorry to say in China, right and in many other. Countries as well. In Korea, in South Korea, many top people, famous people, they fell from grace. We call in English, right? They become disgraced. Yeah, because they lost the integrity. They lost the honesty. People don't trust them anymore. They become corrupted, right? They take bribes. Yeah. So they lost the honesty, the integrity, some of them even end up in gaol, right? We even have one chief executive who end up in gaol. Here in Hong Kong. OK, so integrity or honesty, very important. Now when any number, any big number raise raises to a power I. If you lost that I it becomes 0, right? Any number raises to power 0. Goes back to one right. It goes back to square one. Any number. Raises to power zero. You return to one. Back to square one we call. It in English. You may even end up in gaol. Yeah, but people don't. Please don't bother you anymore. OK, so it's very important this formula. Now divided by T. Everybody knows that. Catching the right time is very important, OK. Everybody knows that when you go into, say, buy stocks or buy houses or whatever, buy at the lowest. And then when time comes, sell it at the highest. So if the delta T you really catch the moment where the stock price is the lowest, and you buy and you catch the price where it's the highest you sell, you make a huge profit. However, can you do that? No, fortunately I think even even super computer. Artificial intelligence AI's may not be able to catch 0. So try to minimise the error. That's all we can do. Try to minimise the time error. Do it at the right time is very important. So I have been lucky enough to do a few things. But I I did it at the exact right time. Make a career move, you know, change jobs, you know, buy stocks. Except the bloody big bitcoins, I mean, I lost some money or lost quite some money on bitcoins, but but other than that you try to catch the moment. Yeah, timing is very important. In fact, timing, some people say is everything. Yeah, timing is everything. So that's the the success formula. I call it and you try to follow this LUCK and try to hold on to your integrity. So don't cheat, you know, don't cheat your exams. I mean, Hong Kong you is now banning ChatGPT, so don't don't try to come up with the same answer to your professor. You know, as your next as the as the next door. So they all come with the same answer. All the six points. OK, that will be quite silly and you'll be considered as patriotism, you know, as copying. So don't do that. Alright, so just to sum up quickly. That's where we started. As I said. 40 years ago, 30 years ago, when I signed up for a computer minor in in the university, you know what I got? You know what I got firstly. 30 years ago, 35 years ago, when I signed up for computer science as a course. I got a key. Yeah, when you sign up, I make I meet it to the computer science. I got a physical key. You know, a key lock key. That's all I got. And you know why? Because of that. Do you see that what it is is a card is a card punching reading machine? And what do I get a key? Because as a student of the computer science class? Each of us is allocated a locker. It's just like your physical, physical education. Your, your, your, your, your PE class, you get a locker to put your stinky socks and your dirty clothes in there. In those days we got a key to get the locker to put our the bunch of cards right. The power cards in there, every pile of card is a programme. We punch holes on a piece of cardboard paper. We punch all the holes there with the punching machine and then read it through this input input device. Called card read. The whole style of and then go in and then read the programme and then the computer will calculate it and then next day, if you're lucky, you get a report. You know you get a power paper and that's the result of your programme by the computer. Come on. That was only what, 30-40 years ago. And today we are here. We are here talking about robots talking about AIS. I leave that to you guys. To tell me. When, 30 years later, 40 years later, what will be here in that white piece of? She's here. What will be light? Infer another 30-40 years and remember. In human history. 30 years. 40 years is so short. It's just a small, tiny little bit of time in the whole history of mankind. And we have come such a long way in just 30-40 years. Remember. Remember I talked about the disc. 2 1/2 megabyte that big today we have that little thing that is 10 terabytes. So the future is. For you guys to decide. I'm probably too old for that, but I hope I will still see some of it. What it's going to be like in another 30-40 years, what is going to be technology? What is going to be fintech?
In banking, it was like that right and now we have the banking here. What's the size of the bank? 6 1/2 inch. That's the size of the bank. Alright. The funny thing is like this, when we talk about the real world, it's like that, you know, we have human touch, we have feelings. You know, we we we like each other. We touch each other. And maybe in the future it's just like that. You know, with matter words, you're on a Google and you just touch like that. I don't know. Maybe both. Maybe we live both in the real world with human feeling human touch as well as maybe the matter was, well, the two may be going in parallel. We may have. The real currency. The Hong Kong dollar, the US dollar on a. Piece of paper. But at the same time, we may have the digital currency and still going together, so different situation you use different currencies. So that may well be the. But then I can't. I can't tell in another 30-40 years from now what it's going to be. Like maybe even digital currency is gone. Maybe even matter worse is gone. I don't know what. It's like. OK, I leave that answer to you guys alright with that, I finished the talk. Thanks a lot indeed. Thank you.
